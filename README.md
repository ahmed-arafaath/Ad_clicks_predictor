# Ad_clicks_predictor
An ML model to predict Ad viewers based on various factors.


The goal of this project was to get familiar with the concept of **multicollinearity** by looking for underlying relations between independent features, practicing **normalizing** and **standardizing** techniques and comparing their accuracy and implementing **kNN** model with various k-values to look for optimal k-value based on the output.


Built kNN model with various k-value, selected a k-value with the lowest error rate, and achieved an accuracy rate of 97%.
